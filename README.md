## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
 A major take-way for me while building this project was working around centering elements with flexbox. I realised that to center an element and add a background that takes just the right amount of space, you need to wrap the contents of that element in a div and give the background color property that you'd like to that div.I also decided to not use percentages for some of my widths as I've learnt this is bad for responsive design at times.


### Continued development

I hope to improve my ability to create responsive sites and web apps. To achieve this I'd need to lay my hands on more projects and  play around with CSS grid and Flexbox. Then what's a developer without JavaScript? New projects here I come..
